## Project/Application Name
  Halfway Meetup

## Project Description
This iOS application was a personal project I decided to do to help facilitate users in finding a place to meetup for drinks, food, or coffee with another person. This app determines the location of both parties and finds meetup spots in the geographic center. The radius within which the results are returned can be expanded to view more possibilities.

## Who uses it?
  Users who are looking to quickly find a spot somewhere between them and another person to meet up for drinks, food, or coffee.

## What outputs do they need?
Marker on map with information:
* Location markers on specific restaurants, bars, and/or coffee shops
* Establishment name
* Establishment rating

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
* User's current location or user's set location
* Other individual's location
* What kind of venue the user is looking for (restaurant, bar, coffee shop)

## What technologies do you plan to use?
* Swift
* Google Maps API
* Google Places API
* Core Location
* Alamofire

## Feature list
* Switches to easily enable the user to turn on or off the app locating the different venue categories
* Expandable radius for returned search results
